# An electronic school enrollment form
A website that helps teachers speeds up calculating points and manage students who have applied for enrollment in their high school. 

I have used pure HTML, CSS, JS, PHP, and MySQL.

I've not used React.js because it doesn't want to work on my laptop. ðŸ˜…

I plan to rebuild this site in react, Node.js, or Go. 

I have a long list of bugs and features to add.

The website is available on the link: [slaven.atwebpages.com](slaven.atwebpages.com);
